# hello-world
Creating first github repository

My name is Tucker Albers, but my legal name is Daniel Carl Tucker Albers. There is a great story to how I found out my first name. Ask me about it for a good laugh.

I graduated from BYU with a degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics. It was my intial exposure to the world of programming and I have been enjoying it since.

I have a Wife Kate and a son Graham. He is trying to climb the counters by using the kitchen drawers. 

I enjoy outdoor sports and am training for a spartan beast race and learning to surf.
